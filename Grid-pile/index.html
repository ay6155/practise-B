            <h2>Magical contect restructing with CSS Grid stacks</h2>
            <div class="bg-contect">
                <p class="con-1">This example demonstrate how to reposition content in a view
                    by stacking multiple grids on top of one another. The goal of the
                    example is to retain a logical markup structure while still allowing
                    content to be split up and positioned on the grid. Case in point:From a
                    HTML semantics standpoint, the main area should come before the sidebar area, and both
                    should lie on the same level witout extra wrappers.This demo shows how stacking two grids
                    allow the sidebars items to appear as if they are placed on the same grid as the main contect
                    while they are in  reality placed in a seprate grid positioned within and superimposed on top of
                    the original grid.

                    <h2>Grid is Great</h2>
                    <p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout tool.it is great for layout 
                    out contect in a grid, and for laying out contect in two dimensions.

                    <h2>Flex is great too</h2>
                    <p> Grid is not always the right option for layout. if for example
                        you need to layout a series of identical boxes like those you see here,
                        flex may be the better option.

                    <h2>Subgrid could be nice here</h2>
                    <p>The solution provided here is limited by the lack of support for subgrids.
                        if subgrids were available, the solution would be more refined. That said,
                        the lack of subgrid was what brought me to this solution, and it has practical 
                        applications well outside of the current demo. So maybe not having subgrid has openes the door
                        to other more intresting opportunites?
